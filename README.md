## install

Unfortunately, it seems like the distributed application can not be shared with others unless the app is code-signed (requries apple dev account). I'd suggest you to build this project from source and you'll be able to find the application in `/out/make`.

If you are not sure how to do above step, you could go to original repo [vincelwt/chatgpt-mac](https://github.com/vincelwt/chatgpt-mac) and download from the link provided.
